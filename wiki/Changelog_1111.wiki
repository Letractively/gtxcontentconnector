#summary This Page describes the major changes from Version 1.10.0 to 1.11.1

= Important Changes = 
  * We now use a maven multi module projet to reduce complexity.
  * group ids changed to com.gentics
= Configuration changes =

= Features =
  * It is now possible to boost complete documents when indexing. An attribute name can be configured and the indexer will then use the value behind this attribute to set the boost value for the document.
{{{
# The field that contains the boostvalue for the current object. 1.0 is default if this attribute is not set or not present.
index.DEFAULT.CR.PAGES.boostAttribute=searchboost
}}}
  * Introduced a cache clear servlet, that can be used to clear datasource caches after one or more items have been changed.
  * You can now configure lazyinit for the databases. If this is set to true, the datasource will not be initialized while loading the configuration file, but on the first request. This can be useful if the database relies on JNDI objects that are not available at startup.
{{{
rp.1.dblazyinit=true # Default = false
}}}
  * You can now fetch update timestamp of the youngest Element with a rule (also supports tree structures).
{{{
#add this to your configuration. you can the use it with &type=YOUNGEST
cr.youngest=com.gentics.cr.rest.misc.YoungestTimestampContentRepository
}}}
  * Added methods to clear the datasource cache to the CRDatabaseFactory. Both for single items and for the whole datasource.
{{{
/**
	 * Clears all cache contents for the object with the given contentid.
	 * @param datasource datasource object on that the cache clear should
	 * 		be performed on.
	 * @param contentId id of the object that should be removed from the cache.
	 */
	public static void clearCache(final Datasource datasource, final String contentId) {
		PortalConnectorHelper.clearCache(datasource, contentId);
	}

	/**
	 * Clears all cache contents for the given datasource.
	 * @param datasource datasource object on that the cache clear should
	 * 		be performed on.
	 */
	public static void clearCache(final Datasource datasource) {
		PortalConnectorHelper.clearCache(datasource);
	}
