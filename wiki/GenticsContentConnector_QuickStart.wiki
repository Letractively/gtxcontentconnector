= Gentics Content Connector and Gentics Search (based on Apache Lucene) =

== Installation and Setup ==
Download the [http://archiva.gentics.com:8081/archiva/browse/com.gentics/contentconnector-servlet-sample Sample Webapp] and the [http://archiva.gentics.com:8081/archiva/browse/com.gentics/contentconnector-config-sample/ Sample Configuration].

Deploy the Sample Webapp to an application server of your liking and start it with the -Dcom.gentics.portalnode.confpath set to the extracted config directory of the Sample Configuration.

For some more information on how to configure the application, have a look at [Configuration].

Once the server has started, point your browser to */servlet-sample/* on it (in most cases this is [http://localhost:8080/servlet-sample/]).

== Getting Started ==

This web app gives access to the content objects in the Gentics Content Repository and offers you the full functionality of the world-famous search framework Apache Lucene enhanced with a lot of functionality.

 * for Content Connector - use expression parser filter rules
 * for Search - use lucene query language
 * for Flat Tables - use SQL

 * 10002 … folders
 * 10007 … pages (html, php, jsp, css, js, xml, text, …)
 * 10008 … binary files (images, files, can be css, js)

=== Examples ===

Request all images (LIKE)

/servlet-sample/ccr?filter=object.url%20LIKE%20%22%jpg%22

Request binary content
To get a binary-content-object request an 10008-object (files, images, not pages) i.e. as json. Request the “obj_type” and “mimetype” as attributes. Before you display the binary content make an additional request for the binary-content to the content-servlet. Send the mime type in the header and then display the binary content.

Request the content of a binary file via content servlet (for reducing load of json-encoding). 

/servlet-sample/content?contentid=10008.93

If the content displayed by the content servlet contains plinks, they will be rendered with the configured plink template. This allows for application specific beautiful URLs.


=== Structure of Gentics Content Connector and the sample webapp ===
Each servlet in the Gentics Content Connector has its own special function. For each servlet a properties file exists in the configuration ... /conf/gentics/rest/. Servlets are configured in the web.xml

The Sample Webapp contains the following servlets:

 * */servlet-sample/* or */servlet-sample/velocity* - the welocme servlet, also a fully functional search with results, paging, dym and autocompletion
 * */servlet-sample/indexer* - it will load on startup and contains the index functionality for the lucene search
 * */servlet-sample/search* - the default search servlet. it can return xml, json and serialized php
 * */servlet-sample/autocomplete* - the autocomplete servlet that is being used for the autocompletion in the welcome servlet
 * */servlet-sample/content* - can deliver content and renders the plinks so that they point to the content portlet itself
 * */servlet-sample/ccr* - can deliver lists / results from the contentrepository in xml, json, and serialized php

Configuration property files:
You can add additional servlets by configuring them in the web.xml and adding a configuration file with the servlet name + .properties as file name.
If the servlet name is “ccr”, the properties file has to be called ccr.properties 

For additional information on configuration have a look at the [Configuration Wiki Page].

Deploy it on an application server. 

The Gentics Portal Connector (this is the raw Java API to the Gentics Content Repository) is a commercial library of the Gentics Content Connector.
