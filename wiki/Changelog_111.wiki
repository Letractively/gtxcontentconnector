#This Page describes the major changes from Verstion 1.1.0 to 1.1.1

= Configuration changes =

== Index Optimization ==
We replaced the following configuration option
{{{
#The following line sets the index job to not optimize the index
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.ignoreoptimize=true
}}}

with the following options. They give more control over the optimization process and do not mislead the user.

{{{
#The following line would set the index job to execute an optimize command on the index after each run (time an memory consuming)
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.optimize=true
#The following line would set the index job to execute an optimize command on the index after each run using a max segement rule => only optimizes when more than max segments are present (not as time and memory consuming) (the line above should be commented out)
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.maxsegments=10
}}}

= Features =

  * FileSystemRequestProcessor (not yet finished) which allows to get and index contents from a directory in the file system. At the moment you can use the attributes "binarycontent", "obj_type" of the resolvables
  * simple performance montoring. we are still working on this.

= Bugfixes =

  * issue #37 is fixed, this caused a not stopable jvm when using RPMergerRequestProcessor
  * various bugfixes that where not reported as an issue, mainly bugfixes to be able to stop the jvm correctly
