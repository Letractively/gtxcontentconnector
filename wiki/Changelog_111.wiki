#This Page describes the major changes from Verstion 1.1.0 to 1.1.1

= Configuration changes =

== Index Optimization ==
We replaced the following configuration option
{{{
#The following line sets the index job to not optimize the index
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.ignoreoptimize=true
}}}

with the following options. They give more control over the optimization process and do not mislead the user.

{{{
#The following line would set the index job to execute an optimize command on the index after each run (time an memory consuming)
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.optimize=true
#The following line would set the index job to execute an optimize command on the index after each run using a max segement rule => only optimizes when more than max segments are present (not as time and memory consuming) (the line above should be commented out)
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.maxsegments=10
}}}

= Features =

  * FileSystemRequestProcessor (not yet finished) which allows to get and index contents from a directory in the file system. At the moment you can use the attributes "binarycontent", "obj_type" of the resolvables
  * simple performance montoring. we are still working on this.
  * VectorBolder which uses search term vectors stored when indexing, so its faster than the old PhraseBolder.
{{{
#Configure the highlighters (sample for VectorBolder)
#Vector Bolder needs Vectors stored in the index so check your indexer.properties
#if index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.storeVectors is set to true (default)
rp.1.highlighter.1.class=com.gentics.cr.lucene.search.highlight.VectorBolder
#Set the attribute that should be highlighted
rp.1.highlighter.1.attribute=content
#Set the rule that defines the objects that should be highlighted with this highlighter
rp.1.highlighter.1.rule=1==1
#Set the max number of fragments that should be present in the highlighted text
rp.1.highlighter.1.fragments=5
#Set the max number of characters a fragment should contain
rp.1.highlighter.1.fragmentsize=100
#Set the tags that should be used for highlighting
rp.1.highlighter.1.highlightprefix=<b>
rp.1.highlighter.1.highlightpostfix=</b>
#Set the seperator that should be used between the fragments
rp.1.highlighter.1.fragmentseperator=...
}}}
  * SearchTerm Vectors are now stored by default when indexing (for faster search and VectorBolder)
{{{
#Makes searches faster, required for VectorBolder, needs more space on disk (about double the space as without Vector), default is true
index.DEFAULT.CR.FILES.storeVectors=true
}}}

= Bugfixes =

  * issue #37 is fixed, this caused a not stopable jvm when using RPMergerRequestProcessor
  * various bugfixes that where not reported as an issue, mainly bugfixes to be able to stop the jvm correctly
