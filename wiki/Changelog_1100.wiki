#summary This Page describes the major changes from Version 1.9.0 to 1.10.0

= Important Changes = 
  
= Configuration changes =

= Features =
 * the velocity tools are now available in the VelocityContentRepository via $tools so now you can use the following code to prevent xss in your search template
{{{
$tools.esc.html($yourquery)
}}}
 * You now have the possibility in the LuceneRequestProcessor to configure the handling of the MaxClauseCount exception. Therefore you have the possiblity to give your users a hint that they should use a longer searchterm. See example in search.properties (as always commented out per default):
{{{
#throw an exception if the maxclausecount is reached and catched, this is useful for handling in the ContentRepository#respondWithError()
rp.1.failOnMaxClauses=true
}}}
 * Now it is possible to deactivate the crcontent cache with setting the crcontentcache property of the RequestPocessor to false, default is true:
{{{
#deatctivate the content cache of the request processor
rp.1.crcontentcache=false
}}}
