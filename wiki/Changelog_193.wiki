Bug fixes for the DidyoumeanIndexExtension, AutocompleteIndexExtension and DefaultIndexAccessor

= Bugs fixed = 
 * fixed: DefaultIndexAccessor opens a IndexWriter and therefore produces a NativeFSLock everytime a reopencheck is perfomed
 * fixed: in Enviroments with multiple IndexLocations the DidyoumeanIndexExtension and AutocompleteIndexExtension would start reindex-Jobs everytime a IndexLocation fires a IndexFinished Event. Both IndexExtensions now only start their Jobs if the IndexLocation to which they extend fired the event.
