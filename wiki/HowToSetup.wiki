= Getting started =

1. Download and install Gentics Portal.Node SDK
	http://www.gentics.com

   Or use the newest version of Eclipse instead
	http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
	Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers

2. Download SubClipse and install 
	http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html

3. Install a maven plugin for eclipse
        We recommend m2eclipse: http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/
 
3. Checkout the projects you want to use

== Maven Settings ==

Configure Access to the Gentics Maven Repository:
        https://maven.gentics.com/

Enable maven dependency support for the checked out project and you will be set to start programming, deploying or whatever you like to do.

== WTP Deployment ==
The m2eclipse plugin also supports the WTP deployment for your integrated tomcat server. Unfortunately this feature is still beta and has some glitches from time to time. The best way to remove any errors is to just restart eclipse and rebuild your workspace.
